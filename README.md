# Decision Tree
## Aim :
To study and apply Data Preprocessing techniques on given dataset. Prepare a Social_Network_Ads dataset for training with machine learning algorithm by applying suitable data preprocessing techniques. Apply decision tree algorithm for classification. Evaluate the performance using Precision, Recall, F1 score and accuracy. Also visualize the decision tree.
### What is a Decision Tree?
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure used to make decisions or predictions. It consists of nodes representing decisions or tests on attributes, branches representing the outcome of these decisions, and leaf nodes representing final outcomes or predictions. Each internal node corresponds to a test on an attribute, each branch corresponds to the result of the test, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label or a continuous value.

#### Structure of a Decision Tree
Root Node: Represents the entire dataset and the initial decision to be made.
Internal Nodes: Represent decisions or tests on attributes. Each internal node has one or more branches.
Branches: Represent the outcome of a decision or test, leading to another node.
Leaf Nodes: Represent the final decision or prediction. No further splits occur at these nodes.

Note : Dataset used is Social_Network_Ads
